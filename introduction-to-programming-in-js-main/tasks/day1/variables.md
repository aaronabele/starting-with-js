# Exercises: Variables

## 01) log out your favorite music artist / band name and song

- [ ] store the name and the song in a variable
- [ ] create a variable that combines both as new string with a seperator like a space or comma.
- [ ] variable names should be camelCase

## 02) Fix the following code snippets

### Wrong result: Expected 3 not undefined

```js
let currentUsers;
currentUsers = 1;
currentUsers = 1;
currentUsers = 1;
console.log(currentUsers);
```

### Wrong result: Expected false not true

```js
console.log("333" == 333);
```

### Wrong result: Expected true cause both values are greater than or equal

```js
console.log(50 + 2 > 52);
```
