# Exercises: Basic Operators with Numbers

## 01) log a statement that returns 20

- [ ] result should be 20
- [ ] use all of the 4 Arithmetic operators to get the result

## 02) Fix the following code snippets

### Wrong result: Expected 555 not 855

```js
console.log(600 + 510 / 2);
```

### Wrong result: Expected false not true

```js
console.log("333" == 333);
```

### Wrong result: Expected true cause both values are greater than or equal

```js
console.log(50 + 2 > 52);
```

### Wrong result: Output should be false. Make it work with the NOT Operator.

```js
console.log(true);
```
